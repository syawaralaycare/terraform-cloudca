```hcl
resource "cloudca_port_forwarding_rule" "web_pfr" {
	service_code = "compute-qc"
	environment_name = "dev"

	protocol = "TCP"
}
```

- public_ip - the public IP address of this rule
- private_ip - the private IP address of this rule
- instance_id - the instance associated with the private IP address of this rule

## cloudca_volume
Manages volumes. Modifying all fields with the exception of instance_id will result in destruction and recreation of the volume.

If the instance_id is updated, where the volume has not yet been attached, the volume will be attached to the instance, where the volume is attached to an existing instance, the volume will be detached from the previous instance and attached to the new instance.

### Example usage
```hcl
resource "cloudca_volume" "data_volume" {
	service_code = "compute-qc"
	environment_name = "dev"

	name = "Data Volume"

	disk_offering = "High Performance SSD"
	size_in_gb = 20
	iops = 2000
	instance_id = "f932c530-5753-44ce-8aae-263672e1ae3f"
}
```

### Argument reference

- environment_name - (Required)
- name - (Required) The name of the volume to be created
- disk_offering - (Required) The name or id of the disk offering to use for the volume
- size_in_gb - (Optional) The size in GB of the volume. Only for disk offerings with custom size.
- iops - (Optional) The number of IOPS of the volume. Only for disk offerings with custom iops.
